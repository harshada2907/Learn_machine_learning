Regression Algorithm
---------------------
- analyze the relationship between variables
- predicts a continuous output(numerical values) based on input features
- understanding how the dependent variable changes with independent variable

- used in problems like House Price Prediction, Weather Prediction, etc

- here we try to find the best fit line that can predict the output more accurately

- They are divided into:
- Linear Regression
- Non-linear Regression


- Linear Regression includes:
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression

- Non-linear Regression includes:
- Polynomial Regression

- Linear Regression
-----------------------
- how dependent variable is changing according to independent variable
- predict price, salary, etc

Types of linear relationship:
- Positive Linear Relationship
	- y increases as the value of x increases
- Negative Linear Relationship
	- y decreases as the value of x increases


- Simple Linear Regression
----------------------------
- relationship between a dependent and a single independent variable
- models the relationship between two variables
- forecasting new observations




For null values in a dataset
------------------------------
- if the dataset is large and the null values are less then in such a case the null values can be dropped
- but if the dataset is small then the null values cannot be dropped as this will decrease the size of the dataset and then will not be able to train the model properly
- so in such cases we can fill those null values
- now these null values can be filled manually too but if the dataset is large then it will consume time and not worthy
- so we can fill those values code.
- now for filling those values there are 3 statistical methods
- mean  median  mode

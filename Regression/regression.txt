Regression Algorithm
---------------------
- analyze the relationship between variables
- predicts a continuous output(numerical values) based on input features
- understanding how the dependent variable changes with independent variable

- used in problems like House Price Prediction, Weather Prediction, etc

- here we try to find the best fit line that can predict the output more accurately

- They are divided into:
- Linear Regression
- Non-linear Regression


- Linear Regression includes:
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression

- Non-linear Regression includes:
- Polynomial Regression

- Linear Regression
-----------------------
- how dependent variable is changing according to independent variable
- predict price, salary, etc

Types of linear relationship:
- Positive Linear Relationship
	- y increases as the value of x increases
- Negative Linear Relationship
	- y decreases as the value of x increases


- Simple Linear Regression
----------------------------
- relationship between a dependent and a single independent variable
- models the relationship between two variables
- forecasting new observations

1) What is machine learning?
--> 
- Basically it allows computers to learn from the data(provided to the model) and make decision(prediction).
- They use statistical techniques.

2) why learn ML(machine learning)?
-->
- high demand, increased career prospects
- it automates repetitive tasks
- large volumes of data --> uncovers pattern --> gain insights --> informed decision making
- forecasting future trends
- applicable in many fields including healthcare, finance, entertainment, marketing, robotics, etc
- it is a fundamental concept of AI

Some applications of ML:
1) Healthcare
- medical imaging
- drug discovery

2) Finance
- fraud detection
- credit scoring

3)Retail
- Personalized recommendations
- Demand Forecasting
- Customer service

4) Transportation
- autonomous vehicles
- route optimization
- Traffic management

5) Education
- personalized learning

6) Security
- Threat Detection
- surveillance

3) What are the steps in ML or lifecycle of ML
-->
1) Gathering the data
- this includes various sources like Kaggle(recommended), Amazon, Microsoft, UCI machine learning repository and even sklearn which is a library used in machine learning contains of datasets

2) Understanding the data
-->
- make the data suitable for ML model
- Handling missing data
	- by deleting the row or column
	- by calculating the mean, median or mode of the column and filling the null/missing values
- Categorical data to numerical data
	 - Label Encoder
	 - Label Encode
	 - get_dummies() function of pandas library
- Feature Scaling
	- to ensure features are in the same scale

4) Model Selection
-->
- regression - when the model needs to predict continuous outcome
- eg: house price prediction, Salary Prediction

- classification - when the output is categorical, classes are included
- eg:- true/false, yes/no, 0/1, play/don't play, etc


5) Train and test the model
--> 
- it is necessary because once we build a model it is essential to know the accuracy of the model for its deployment 
- so for better performance the model should be tested
- the dataset can be divided into training and testing data
- train data is used to create the model
- test data is used to test the accuracy of the model

6) Deploy the model
-->
- GUI(Graphical User Interface) - eg: using python tkinter library
- CUI(Command Line Interface) - eg: python command line
- Web Application - streamlit or host on cloud

Machine Learning Algorithms are classified into two types:
1) Supervised Machine Learning 
2) Unsupervised Machine Learning

Supervised Machine Learning:
- It is used for predicting the output.
- input data(features) and output data(target/tag/label) is provided in input data.
- Supervised learning algorithms are classified as follows:
	- Regression
	- Classification
- algorithm includes:
	- Linear Regression
	- Multiple Linear Regression
	- Polynomial Regression
	- Logistic Regression
	- Naive Bayes
	- Decision Tree
	- Random Forest
	- K Nearest Neighbors
etc


Unsupervised Machine Learning:
- It is used for finding hidden patterns.
- only input data(features) are given to the model. 
- Unsupervised leaning algorithms are classified as follows:
	- Clustering
	- Association

- algorithms includes:
	- K means clustering
	- k medoids clustering
etc
